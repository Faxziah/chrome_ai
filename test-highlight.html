        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</p>
        
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference instead of following program instructions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Deep Learning and Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs.</p>
        
        <p>Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. These systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.</p>
        
        <p>The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Computer Vision and Image Recognition</h2>
        <p>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.</p>
        
        <p>Image recognition is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images. Computers can use machine vision technologies in combination with a camera and artificial intelligence software to achieve image recognition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Robotics and Automation</h2>
        <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.</p>
        
        <p>Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance. Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention.</p>
